# Avengers_Data_Analysis

Was reading about wordcloud and its implementation and thought of using this library on the earth's mightiest heroes: The Avengers!!

I have scraped the transcripts from (https://transcripts.fandom.com/wiki) for the following movies = 
The Avengers
Avengers: Age of Ultron
Avengers: Infinity wars
Avengers: Endgame. 

Then I have used regex to separate the character and his/her dialogue. 
Finally, I passed the text for each character(only one as an example in the code) into wordcloud and plotted it out using matplotlib. 

## Output
